#stage 2.3 Botany and Plant Science

#Some scientists are trying to engineer mutants for a crop to become resistant to a pesticide
#They compared the metabolic response of the engineered mutants to the metabolic response of the wild type plants
#The took readings after 8 and 24 hours


#Task 1: 
#Calculate the difference in metabolic response (ΔM) between the DMSO treatment from the 24 hours treatment for the wild type and mutants
