#Task 2.6
#Transcriptomics
#This is a processed RNAseq dataset involving reading in quantitated gene expression data from an RNA-seq experiment, 
#exploring the data using base R functions and then interpretation. 
#The dataset contains an experiment between a diseased cell line and diseased cell lines treated with compound X.
#The difference in expression change between the two health status is computed as Fold change to log 2 (Log2FC) and the significance of each is computed in p-value.

#Generate a volcano plot. 
# Determine the upregulated genes (Genes with Log2FC > 1 and pvalue < 0.01)
# Determine the downregulated genes (Genes with Log2FC < -1 and pvalue < 0.01)
# What are the functions of the top 5 upregulated genes and top 5 downregulated genes. (Use genecards)
